2. **Builder Pattern**: Configuration and registry creation
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple replacement strategies in EditTool
4. **Observer Pattern**: File watching with event callbacks
5. **Factory Pattern**: Environment-specific registry creation
6. **Command Pattern**: Tool execution with context

## Security Features

2. **Command Filtering**: Blocks dangerous commands and patterns
3. **Content Validation**: Checks file sizes, encodings, and content safety
4. **Permission Gating**: Risk-based approval workflow
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
6. **Resource Limits**: Timeouts, size limits, and memory constraints

    json!({"filePath": "/path/to/file.txt"}),
    context
).await?;
```

### **Configuration**
```rust
let config = ToolConfig {
    enable_audit_logging: true,
    audit_log_path: Some(PathBuf::from("audit.log")),
    permission_provider: PermissionProviderConfig::Interactive { 
        auto_approve_low_risk: true

};

let registry = ToolRegistryFactory::create_with_config(config)?;
