# Code Mesh Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **Code Mesh**, a high-performance AI coding assistant built with Rust and WebAssembly.

## What is Code Mesh?

Code Mesh is a next-generation AI coding assistant that combines the power of multiple language models with a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system. Inspired by [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), Code Mesh is built from the ground up in Rust to provide:

- **ü¶Ä Native Performance**: Built in Rust for maximum speed and efficiency
- **üåê WebAssembly Support**: Run in browsers or Node.js via NPX
- **üß© Modular Architecture**: Three specialized crates with clear separation of concerns
- **ü§ñ Multi-LLM Support**: Unified interface for Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Mistral, and more
- **üîß Comprehensive Tool System**: File operations, code search, web tools, and custom extensions
- **üîê Secure Authentication**: OAuth and API key support with encrypted storage
- **üì¶ Easy Distribution**: Install via `npx code-mesh` - no manual setup required

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Code Mesh employs multiple specialized AI agents that work together to solve complex coding tasks:

- **Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex requests into manageable tasks
- **Coder Agent**: Implements code changes with context awareness
- **Tester Agent**: Runs tests and validates implementations
- **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews code quality and suggests improvements

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

Thanks to Rust and WebAssembly, Code Mesh runs everywhere:

- **Native CLI**: Full-featured command-line interface
- **Browser**: Run directly in web applications
- **Node.js**: Use via NPX without installation
- **IDE Integration**: Extensible for VS Code, IntelliJ, and more

### Intelligent Context Management

Code Mesh maintains intelligent context across sessions:

- **Project Awareness**: Understands your entire codebase
- **Session Memory**: Remembers previous conversations
- **File Context**: Tracks changes and dependencies
- **Agent Memory**: Agents learn from past interactions
