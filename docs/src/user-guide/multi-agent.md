# Multi-Agent Workflows

Code Mesh's most powerful feature is its sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents to solve complex coding tasks efficiently and reliably.

## Overview

Instead of using a single AI to handle everything, Code Mesh employs multiple specialized agents that work together:

- **🎯 Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex requests into manageable tasks
- **💻 Coder Agent**: Implements code changes with deep context awareness  
- **🧪 Tester Agent**: Runs tests, validates implementations, and ensures quality
- **🔍 Reviewer Agent**: Reviews code quality, suggests improvements, and ensures best practices
- **📚 Documenter Agent**: Generates and maintains documentation
- **🔧 Optimizer Agent**: Analyzes and optimizes performance

## How Multi-Agent Workflows Work

### 1. Request Analysis

When you make a complex request, the **Planner Agent** analyzes it:

```bash
code-mesh run "Add user authentication with JWT tokens to my Express app"
```

The Planner Agent:
- Understands the full scope of the request
- Identifies dependencies between tasks
- Creates a structured implementation plan
- Estimates complexity and effort

### 2. Plan Creation

The Planner creates a detailed plan:

```
[AI:Planner] Analyzing request: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

Plan Created:
1. 📋 Create user model and database schema
2. 🔑 Implement JWT token generation and validation utilities  
3. 🛡️ Create authentication middleware
4. 🚪 Add login and logout API endpoints
5. 🔒 Protect existing routes with authentication
6. 🧪 Add comprehensive test coverage
7. 📖 Update API documentation

Dependencies:
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (user model needed for JWT)
- Task 3 depends on Task 2 (middleware needs JWT utils)
- Tasks 4,5 depend on Task 3 (endpoints need middleware)
- Task 6 depends on Tasks 1-5 (tests need implementation)

Estimated time: 45-60 minutes
Complexity: Medium-High
```

### 3. Plan Review and Approval

You review and can modify the plan:

```
[CodeMesh] Review plan? (y/n/edit/details): 
```

Options:
- **`y`**: Approve and proceed
- **`n`**: Reject and cancel
- **`edit`**: Modify the plan interactively
- **`details`**: Show more detailed breakdown

### 4. Coordinated Execution

Agents execute tasks in optimal order:

```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Execution

For tasks with strong dependencies:

```
Planner → Coder → Tester → Reviewer
    ↓        ↓       ↓        ↓
   Plan → Code → Tests → Review
```

### Parallel Execution

For independent tasks:

```
Planner → Coder (Frontend) ┐
       → Coder (Backend)   ├→ Tester → Reviewer
       → Coder (Database)  ┘
```

### Iterative Refinement

For complex tasks requiring multiple rounds:

```
Planner → Coder → Tester → Reviewer
    ↑       ↓       ↓        ↓
    └─── Refine ←── Fail ←───┘
```

## Multi-Agent Commands

### Planning Mode

Start with detailed planning:

```bash
code-mesh run "Implement OAuth2 authentication" --mode plan
```

This activates the Planner Agent first, creates a comprehensive plan, and waits for your approval before proceeding.

### Parallel Mode

Execute independent tasks in parallel:

```bash
code-mesh run "Add both REST API and GraphQL support" --mode parallel
```

This identifies independent tasks and runs multiple Coder Agents simultaneously.

### Review Mode

Focus on code quality and review:

```bash
code-mesh run "Review and improve the entire user service" --mode review
```

This activates the Reviewer Agent first, analyzes existing code, and creates improvement plans.

### Test Mode

Focus on testing and quality assurance:

```bash
code-mesh run "Add comprehensive tests for the payment system" --mode test
```

This activates the Tester Agent with enhanced focus on test coverage and quality.

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through a shared context:

### Shared Memory

All agents have access to:
- **Project Context**: File structure, dependencies, configuration
- **Conversation History**: Previous messages and decisions
- **Task State**: Current plan, completed tasks, pending work
- **Knowledge Base**: Learned patterns, team preferences, common solutions

### Message Passing

Agents can send messages to each other:

```
[AI:Planner → AI:Coder] Use the existing User model in src/models/user.js
[AI:Coder → AI:Tester] I've added the login endpoint, please test with edge cases
[AI:Tester → AI:Reviewer] Tests found a potential SQL injection vulnerability
[AI:Reviewer → AI:Coder] Please sanitize the username input in login endpoint
```

### Coordination Protocols

Agents follow coordination protocols:

1. **Handoff Protocol**: Clean task transitions between agents
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicting recommendations
3. **Progress Reporting**: Regular status updates to user
4. **Error Escalation**: Escalate blocking issues to user

## Configuration

### Agent Settings

```toml
[agents]
max_concurrent = 3           # Maximum parallel agents
planning_enabled = true      # Enable planning phase
timeout = 300               # Task timeout in seconds
memory_limit = "1GB"        # Memory limit per agent

[agents.planner]
model_override = "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
max_tasks = 15
auto_approve = false        # Always ask for plan approval

[agents.coder]
model_override = "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"  
max_file_size = "1MB"
backup_enabled = true       # Backup files before editing
auto_format = true          # Format code automatically

[agents.tester]
model_override = "openai/gpt-4"
auto_run_tests = true       # Run tests automatically
coverage_threshold = 80     # Minimum coverage percentage
test_timeout = 300          # Test execution timeout

[agents.reviewer]
model_override = "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
strict_mode = false         # Relaxed vs strict review standards
security_focus = true       # Extra focus on security issues
```

### Model Assignment Strategy

Different agents can use different models optimized for their tasks:

```toml
# High-capability models for complex reasoning
[agents.planner]
model_override = "anthropic/claude-3-opus"

# Fast, efficient models for code generation
[agents.coder]
model_override = "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"

# Logic-focused models for testing
[agents.tester]  
model_override = "openai/gpt-4"

# Quality-focused models for review
[agents.reviewer]
model_override = "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Custom Agent Roles

Define specialized agents for your domain:

```bash
# Frontend-focused workflow
code-mesh run "Implement the dashboard UI" \
  --agents "planner,frontend-coder,ui-tester,accessibility-reviewer"

# Backend-focused workflow  
code-mesh run "Build the API service" \
  --agents "planner,backend-coder,api-tester,security-reviewer"

# Full-stack workflow
code-mesh run "Implement user management" \
  --agents "planner,frontend-coder,backend-coder,integration-tester,full-reviewer"
```

### Agent Chains

Create complex workflows:

```bash
# Research → Plan → Implement → Test → Document
code-mesh run "Add payment processing with Stripe" \
  --chain "researcher,planner,coder,tester,documenter"
```

### Conditional Agents

Activate agents based on conditions:

```bash
# Only run optimizer if performance tests fail
code-mesh run "Optimize the search function" \
  --conditional "optimizer:if_performance_below_threshold"
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Agent Status

Monitor active agents:

```bash
# Show active agents
code-mesh status --agents

# Show detailed agent information
code-mesh agents list --detailed

# Show agent communication log
code-mesh agents log --since 1h
```

### Performance Metrics

Track agent performance:

```bash
# Show agent performance stats
code-mesh agents metrics

# Show task completion times
code-mesh agents timing --last 10

# Show agent resource usage
code-mesh agents resources
```

### Debugging Failed Workflows

When multi-agent workflows fail:

```bash
# Show detailed execution log
code-mesh debug --session last --verbose

# Replay workflow with different settings
code-mesh replay --session <id> --single-agent

# Show agent decision reasoning
code-mesh explain --task <task-id>
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Planning

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requirements
2. **Set Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Define Success**: Specify acceptance criteria
4. **Consider Constraints**: Mention time, performance, or compatibility requirements

### Agent Coordination

1. **Review Plans**: Always review complex plans before execution
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for agent coordination issues
3. **Intervene When Needed**: Stop and redirect if agents go off-track
4. **Learn from Patterns**: Note successful coordination patterns for reuse

### Performance Optimization

1. **Right-Size Models**: Use appropriate models for each agent type
2. **Parallel When Possible**: Enable parallel execution for independent tasks
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and timeout limits
4. **Cache Decisions**: Leverage agent memory for repeated patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agents Conflicting
```bash
# Enable conflict resolution
code-mesh run "your request" --conflict-resolution strict

# Or use single agent mode
code-mesh run "your request" --single-agent
```

#### Poor Coordination
```bash
# Enable verbose coordination logging
code-mesh run "your request" --coordination-log verbose

# Review agent communication
code-mesh agents communication --session last
```

#### Resource Exhaustion
```bash
# Reduce concurrent agents
code-mesh config set agents.max_concurrent 2

# Increase timeouts
code-mesh config set agents.timeout 600
```

Multi-agent workflows represent the future of AI-assisted development, enabling sophisticated problem-solving that goes far beyond what any single AI can accomplish. Master these patterns to unlock Code Mesh's full potential! 🚀
